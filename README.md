## What's this?
ws-bike-rental, a very early research / learning project about multi-framework server, we've decided to make our server special, which means we have decided to make ESX scripts able to run on Our server `(QBCore Framework)`, so we've spent a really long time on this project since we don't know much about ESX, but we made it in the end of the research, successfully making it able to run on our server.

## How does it work?
since multi-core might be really messed up, so we decided to make the ** ESX Functions** work on our server, by turning them into similar **QBCore Functions** and did some changes and some optimization, and that's how it works!
